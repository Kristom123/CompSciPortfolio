    <h1> What is the most common color for deformity in M&ampM's? </h1>
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p> 
     We collected data by first counting out how many of each color were deformed in a 2 lb bag of M&ampMs. We then measured their mass to see 
     how they compared to the average mass of an M&ampM. After that we went on a google sheet and recorded the color, the mass, and also the reason 
     why it was deformed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Data Anaylisis</h2>
    <p>
    Some of the patterns we found were the deformed M&ampsMs were usually dented. Out of 100 deformed M&ampMs 42 were dented while the second highest deformity 
    was cracked, at 25% of M&ampMs. We also found out that the average weight of unusual M&ampsM were 0.789g while the average weight of
    a regular M&ampM was 0.915g. Of all the colors we sampled we found that purple M&ampMs had the most deformities, coming in at 27 out of 100. In second place
    blue and green are tied with 21 deformities each.
